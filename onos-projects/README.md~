## Security Validation using ONOS
```
This project contains code which creates mininet topologies
resembling common cyber architectures employed in Micro grids.
It groups hosts into enclaves (based on function) and restricts
inter enclave and intra enclave communication based on commonly
employed Microgrid security policies.

An ONOS controller is used to enforce these policies using VLANs
and these policies are then validated for correctness

#Dependencies
 -mininet
 -vlan (sudo apt-get install vlan)
```
